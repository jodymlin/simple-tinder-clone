# Simple Tinder Clone with React Native

Note: This is based off [Assignment 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108T1cuw8UEpmot-nqcPr9Mz5EHBKiie9jXiLGqVgXbc/edit) from [Stanford's CS47](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs47)
course

## Running the Application
Download [Expo](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and type `expo start` in the terminal to start
the app. 

## About the Tinder Clone
This uses the `SwipeCards` from the `react-native-swipe-cards` module. However, I added a few modifications
mentioned in the module's PR list to get rid of errors regarding `useNativeAction`.  

### Available Functionality
* swipe right to like
* swipe left to dislike
* press like button to like
* press dislike button to dislike
* can return to previous profile with the 'rewind' button
